# TrainAutomation
## Objectives
1. To understand mutual exclusion and synchronization techniques
2. To work with Mutex Variables in Pthreads.
## Description
We have decided to improve the train efficiency by automating not just the trains but also the
passengers. From now on, passengers will be robots. Each robot and each train is controlled
by a thread. You have been hired to write synchronization functions that will guarantee
orderly loading of trains.
